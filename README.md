**SynerevalAI** is a tool designed to evaluate and compare responses generated by large language models (LLMs) using multiple metrics and approaches. Its goal is to provide multimodal evaluation that enables analysis of the quality and effectiveness of responses across various contexts.

## Applications and Objectives

- **Applications:**
  - Comparative evaluation of different LLMs on specific tasks.
  - Detailed analysis of generated responses to identify strengths and areas for improvement.
  - Development of customized benchmarks tailored to specific evaluation needs.
  - Grading student responses in educational settings via Excel files.

- **Objectives:**
  - Provide a flexible and extensible platform for evaluating LLMs.
  - Integrate multiple evaluation metrics to offer a comprehensive view of model performance.
  - Facilitate objective comparisons between various models and configurations.
  - Allow customization of evaluation metrics and methods according to user requirements.
    
## Implemented Architecture

Below is the implemented architecture, which includes three evaluation tools (OpenAI, BERT, Prometheus-eval). The inputs received and the expected outputs when evaluating model responses are also described.

## Local Setup

This project is developed in **Python**.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SantiagoM99/Synerevalai.git
cd Synerevalai
```

### 2. Create and Activate the Virtual Environment

On Unix systems:

```bash

```

On Windows:

```batch
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a **.env** file in the project's root directory with necessary environment variables, such as API keys or specific configurations. Be sure to check the documentation or source code to identify required variables.

### 5. Run the Application

To start the FastAPI server, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

The server will run at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
